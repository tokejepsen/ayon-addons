Ayon addons
===========

Temporary backup of WIP addons before they have their own repositories

At the moment this repository only holds all the addon settings for AYON server. The functional code is still part of https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype repository. Installing these plugin settings to the server, however, allows using OpenPype desktop application with AYON server for testing purposes.
